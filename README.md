PCA is largely used on yield curve, but rarely it is used in a time-serie perspective.
The advanantages of performing different pca considering dirrent time subsapmles, in this case on us treasury rates, are relevant:
A) It is possibile to study the time-series intensity of normality violation assumptions, as the number of observations exceeding the admissible mahalanobis distance
B) It is possible to study the trend of the elasticity of the term structure of interest rate volatlity.
C) It is possible to recover a volatlity surface: i.e. a time-series evolution of term strcuture of volatlity
D) Last, but not least, an eye should be devoted to observe the time-series evolution of the explanatory power of the first i components, with i=1,2,3 (level,level+slope,level+slope+curvature). Results suggest that in presence of relevant financial frictions there are negative jumps in explanatory power of first i components, with i=1,2. By contrast, considering the first three terms, we never fall below 90% explained variance.
